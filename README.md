# Hello, World!

This is my template repository with humble setup for CI/CD on free-tier VMs.

## How to use
- Add `REMOTE_HOST`, `REMOTE_USER` and `SERVER_SSH_KEY` on [secrets](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
- Put the code on `/src`
- Write your own `build.sh` and `run.sh` scripts, to make they do what they should do 😁

Feel free to add tests, PR workflows, Docker etc... this is just a small start
